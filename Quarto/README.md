# Quarto
This is an agent that plays games of quarto based on MiniMax algorithm.
It may not be the best  agent, but it does the job. Considering my very narrow experience with python, I tried to do my best with lots of help from StackOverFlow and Google and basically searching every page for information.


Note: 
The “is_game_over” and evaluate functions should be implemented in the Quarto class. The “is_game_over “ function should return True if the game is over and False otherwise. The evaluate function should return the evaluation score of the current state of the game, with a positive score indicating a win for the maximizing player, a negative score indicating a win for the minimizing player, and a zero  score indicating a draw.
I have provided the code for the updated version of ‘Quarto’ class that includes the “is_game_over” and “evaluate” functions to avoid any misunderstandings. Hopefully, it would be a self-explanatory part.
